### General Information
Hi, thank you for taking the time to look through my app. This is fairly simple app where a user can search through http://www.omdbapi.com/ API for films, tv-shows, and so forth. It features live search, updating search results in real time as the user types, and infinite scrolling. It has two main routes. One for seeing search results, and one for seeing the movie/tv-show.
